                            <p>
                                I am a trans person, and Luna is my chosen name. Despite the number of fictional
                                characters I like who share the name, it wasn&apos;t directly inspired by any of them, I
                                just think the moon is pretty.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                As for &quot;Flare&quot;, I appreciate the aesthetic of fire. This may sound
                                pretentious, but in a very small way I like to think of myself as aspiring to the ideals
                                of <InlineLink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus">Prometheus</InlineLink> -
                                as he stole the knowledge of fire from the gods and spread it to humanity, my goal is to
                                make anything I discover accessible to the public for the benefit of all.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                Additionally, I enjoy the paradoxical notion of a &quot;Lunar Flare&quot;. Taking
                                something usually associated with my opposite, the sun, and claiming the term for
                                myself. I can be a bit chuuni at times, and it brings to mind a surge of magical power.

                                <InlineLink url="https://www.mariowiki.com/Kretin">Alpha Kretin</InlineLink> is a
                                unimportant boss from Mario & Luigi: Bowser&apos;s Inside Story. I picked the username a
                                long, long time ago, when I was a young teenager. I&apos;d recently been on a spree of
                                constantly reimagining my username for various website, and losing track of which was
                                which. I wanted to pick something that would last a long time, so rather than naming it
                                after a passing passion, I went for something that would remain evergreen - Mario.
                                However, I didn&apos;t want to come across as a Mario superfan or something, or wind up
                                having the name taken everywhere, so I wanted it to be a relatively obscure element of
                                the Mario series. Hence, a minor boss.

                            <p>
                                My intention paid off, and I wound up using the username for years and years. I only
                                changed to LunaFlare in most public spaces very recently, and in some places it&apos;s
                                more trouble than it&apos;s worth to change. That includes my domain name, which I
                                bought at a cheap price a few years ago. lunaflare.com is unfortunately a premium
                                domain, so rather than go broke to make the switch, I&apos;m sticking with this for my
                                personal website.
